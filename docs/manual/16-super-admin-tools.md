*Super admins only. These pages are under **Super Admin** in the menu.*

These are the maintenance tools. Most super admins will never need them from one month to the
next, and that is fine. What follows is enough to know **what each page is, when to open it,
and when to stop and ask a developer.**

## Backup & Restore

A backup is a complete copy of the record book as it stood at a moment in time. If something
goes badly wrong — a bulk change that should not have happened, a corrupted record — a backup
is what gets the organisation back.

> **Important: this page only works on a computer that is running the backup service.** It is
> not something you can use from a phone or an ordinary browser. If the page says *"Error
> loading backups"* or *"Firebase credentials not found"*, you are on a machine that is not
> set up for it. That is not a fault you can fix from this page — ask a developer.

When it does load, you see **Latest Backup** at the top and **All Backups** below, each with
the date and time it was taken.

### The buttons at the top

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Create New Backup** | Takes a fresh copy of the record book as it stands right now. |
| **Trim Backups** | Deletes older backups to save space. |
| **Purge Local DB** | Empties the copy of the record book held on this computer. ("DB" is short for database — the record book itself.) |
| **Copy to Local DB** | Copies the live record book down onto this computer. |

### The buttons on each backup

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Delete** | Removes that backup permanently. |
| **Restore to Local** | Loads it into the copy on this computer. |
| **Restore to Development** | Loads it into the practice copy of the app — the shared test site. |
| **Restore to Production** | **Loads it into the real, live app, replacing what is there now.** |

### Read this before touching anything

**Restore to Production replaces the live record book.** Everything recorded since that backup
was taken — every donation, every new donor, every comment — is gone. This is the single most
destructive button in the whole application.

Sensible habits:

- **Take a new backup before restoring an old one.** Then a mistake is recoverable.
- **Restore to Local or Development first** and look at the result before touching production.
- **Do not restore in the middle of a busy day.** Whatever volunteers are entering at that
  moment will be lost.
- **When in doubt, don't.** Ask a developer. Nothing here is so urgent that it cannot wait an
  hour.

Creating a backup, on the other hand, is completely safe. Do that whenever you like.

## Schema Inconsistencies

This page finds **records with something wrong in them**. Not wrong information — the app
cannot know that a phone number is out of date — but records that are malformed: a field that
should always be filled in and is empty, a field holding the wrong kind of value, a leftover
field from an older version of the app.

These usually arrive through bulk imports, or from data that predates a change in the app.

Tap **Refresh** and the page lists what it found, grouped into kinds:

- **Missing required fields** — something that must be present is not there
- **Empty required fields** — present, but blank
- **Wrong type of value** — text where a number belongs, and similar
- **Extra fields** — leftovers the app no longer uses
- **Rule violations** — a value outside what is allowed, such as an impossible phone number

**The list got longer, and that is the fix.** Until recently this page could not see a missing
field whenever the app had a sensible stand-in value for it. A donor record with no role recorded,
for instance, was read as "Donor" everywhere in the app, so the page saw a role and reported
nothing — while the record itself still had none. That blind spot is gone, so the list may now name
things that were always there and were never shown to you. Longer is not worse.

**What you should do with it:** treat it as a to-do list, not an emergency. Most entries are
harmless leftovers. Where a real donor record is named, you can usually fix it by opening that
donor's profile and filling in what is missing.

If the list is long, or nothing on it makes sense, send it to a developer. The output is aimed
at them, not at you, and reading it is not part of your job.

**If the page cannot reach the server**, it says so in a yellow box, tells you the server is
expected at `localhost:4000`, and links to the setup instructions. This is normal when you are
not running the app on your own machine — the report comes from a developer-only server. Nothing
is broken; the page simply has nothing to show. Any other failure appears in a red box with the
reason. Either way, **Refresh** tries again.

## Dev Console

A running log of what the app is doing behind the scenes, kept while the page is open.

**You do not need to understand it.** Its only purpose is this: when something misbehaves and
a developer asks "what does the Dev Console say?", this is where you look. Open the page,
reproduce the problem, screenshot what appears, send it on.

Nothing on this page changes anything. It is safe to open and safe to ignore.

## Certificate Enabled Donors

A list of **every donor who can produce a certificate**, across every hall, on one page.

A donor has no certificate until somebody switches it on for them, by ticking **Enable
certificate** on their profile — see [The certificate](07-the-donor-profile.md#the-certificate).
That tick is not a super admin's job: **any volunteer or hall admin who can edit a donor can
enable that donor's certificate**, and they are meant to. This page is the other side of that.
It is the only place in the app where the whole set is visible at once.

That matters because a certificate is the one document the app produces that leaves the building.
It gets printed, signed, carried, and checked by people who scan the QR code on the paper and have
no account here. Once it exists, you cannot see where it went.

The page opens straight into the list — there is no button to press. At the top is the count. Each
row shows the donor's name, hall, student ID, blood group and role, and rows are grouped by hall so
they can be checked against the person who would know. **Tap a row to open that donor's profile**
in a new window, which is where you would turn the certificate off again if it should not be on.

Archived donors appear here too, marked **Archived**. That is deliberate and it is worth
understanding: archiving a donor does **not** disable their certificate. Someone who has left, whose
record was archived, may still have a certificate that verifies. Those rows are the ones most worth
a second look.

### What to do with it

Read down it occasionally and ask whether each name should be there. What you are looking for is a
name nobody can account for. If you find one, open the profile and untick the box.

Two things this page does not tell you:

- **It does not say who has actually printed or used a certificate.** Nothing records that. The
  list is who *can*, not who *did*.
- **It does not undo anything.** Turning the tick off stops the certificate verifying from that
  moment. It does nothing to paper already printed and already in someone's hands — that copy still
  looks exactly as it did, and its QR code will simply stop confirming it.

The page changes nothing on its own. It is safe to open.

## AI Integration

This page prepares **one file to hand to an AI assistant** — the kind you type instructions to in
plain English. The file explains to it how Badhan's records can be reached, and it carries a
sign-in inside it. With that file, an assistant can answer questions like *"find O+ donors in
Titumir who have not donated since March"* without anyone writing code.

You do not need to understand what is in the file. Two buttons:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Download Prompt File** | Saves the file to your device, named `badhan-api-prompt.md`. |
| **Copy to Clipboard** | Puts the same text on the clipboard, to paste straight into an assistant. |

**Preview the file (token hidden)** opens the whole text so you can read it first. No sign-in
appears in the preview, and none exists yet: nothing is created until you press one of the two
buttons.

The page also names the **server the file points at**. A file made here works only against that
server.

### The file stops working after 30 minutes

The sign-in inside the file is **not your own**. Each press of a button asks the server for a
fresh **temporary token that expires 30 minutes later**, and the file is dead from then on — the
assistant simply starts getting refused. Nothing you do here affects your own session, and you
stay signed in as normal.

Because the clock starts when you press the button, **make the file when you are ready to use
it**, not in advance. If a file has gone stale, come back and press the button again; there is no
limit on how many you make.

### Read this before you send that file anywhere

For those 30 minutes the token **is you**. Anyone holding the file can do everything your role
allows, as you, without knowing your password — read every donor, and change or delete records.
Thirty minutes is plenty of time for that.

So, while it is live, treat the file as you would treat your password:

- **Do not email it, post it in a group chat, or put it in shared storage.**
- **Do not give it to an assistant you would not trust with your password.** Pasting it into an
  online service sends that token to that company.
- **Delete the downloaded file when you are done with it.** It expires on its own, but there is no
  reason to leave it lying about.

**If it goes somewhere it should not have, sign out.** Signing out ends the session every token
from this page hangs off, including one still inside its 30 minutes. Otherwise, waiting half an
hour is itself the fix.

An assistant working from this file is **not restricted** to reading. It can add, change and
delete real records while the token lasts, and the app cannot tell its actions apart from yours —
the App Activity page will show them as yours. Everything in
[chapter 17](17-rules-the-app-enforces.md) still applies: it can do exactly what your role allows,
no more, and it is a super admin's role you would be lending it.
